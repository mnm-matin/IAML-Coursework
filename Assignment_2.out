\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.2.1}{\(2 points\) The K-Means algorithm is non-deterministic. Explain why this is, and how the final model is selected in the SKLearn implementation of KMeans.}{section.2}% 6
\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.2.2}{\(1 point\) One of the parameters we need to specify when using k-means is the number of clusters. What is a reasonable number for this problem and why?}{section.2}% 7
\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.2.3}{\(5 points\) We will use the Adjusted Mutual Information \(AMI\) i.e. adjusted\137mutual\137info\137score between the clusters and the true \(known\) labels to quantify the performance of the clustering. Give an expression for the MI in terms of entropy. In short, describe what the MI measures about two variables, why this is applicable here and why it might be difficult to use in practice. Hint: MI is sometimes referred to as Information Gain: note that you are asked only about the standard way we defined MI and not the AMI which is adjusted for the size of the domain and for chance agreement.}{section.2}% 8
\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.2.4}{\(4 points\) Fit K-Means objects with n\137clusters ranging from 2 to 12. Set the random seed to 1000 and the number of initialisations to 50, but leave all other values at default. For each fit compute the adjusted mutual information \(there is an SKLearn function for that\). Set average\137method=`max'. Plot the AMI scores against the number of clusters \(as a line plot\).}{section.2}% 9
\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.2.5}{\(3 points\) Discuss any trends and interesting aspects which emerge from the plot. Does this follow from your expectations?}{section.2}% 10
\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.2.6}{\(6 points\) Let us investigate the case with four \(4\) clusters in some more detail. Using seaborn's countplot function, plot a bar-chart of the number of data-points with a particular class \(encoded by colour\) assigned to each cluster centre \(encoded by position on the plot's x-axis\).

\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.3.5}{\(5 points\) We will now optimise the Regularisation parameter C using cross-validation. Train a logistic regressor for different values of C: in each case, evaluate the F1 score on the training and validation portion of the fold. That is, for each value of C you must provide the training set and validation-set scores per fold and then compute \(and store\) the average of both over all folds. Finally plot the \(average\) training and validation-set scores as a function of C. Hint: Use a logarithmic scale for C, spanning 19 samples between 10-4 to 105.}{section.3}% 18
\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.3.6}{\(7 points\) What is the optimal value of C \(and the corresponding score\)? How did you choose this value?

Why are the latter unreasonable in such a dataset? Hint: Refer to the documentation for how to interpret the pollutant values.}{section.4}% 22
\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.4.2}{\(6 points\) Repeat the same analysis but this time on a per-site basis. Provide a table with the number of samples and percentage of problematic samples \(negative and missing\) in each site. To report numbers, count a row which has at least one missing entry as having missing data, and similarly for negative entries. Hint: Pandas has a handy method, to\137latex\(\), for generating a latex table from a dataframe.}{section.4}% 23

\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.4.4}{\(3 points\) Given that the columns are all oxides of nitrogen and hence we expect them to be related, we will now look at correlations in our data. This will also be useful in determining how well we can predict any one of the readings from the other two.

Visualise the coefficients between each pair of columns in a table.}{section.4}% 25

\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.4.6}{\(5 points\) For each of the three pollutants, compute the Pearson correlation between sites.

\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.5.4}{\(5 points\) Generate three figures, one for the mean and one for each of the first 2 principal components: in each, plot the mean/component as three lines, one for each pollutant throught one day cycle. Hint: You will need to reshape the components appropriately.}{section.5}% 33
\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.5.5}{\(6 points\) Focusing on the mean and first principal component, are there any significant patterns which emerge throughout the day? Hint: Think about car usage throughout the day. What is different when interpreting the mean versus the first component? Hint: Do peaks signify the same thing in both cases? Looking at the principal components only, are there any significant differences between the pollutants? Why could this be happening? Hint: You can refer to one of the limitations of PCA.}{section.5}% 34
\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.6}{: \(41 points\) Regression}{}% 35
\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.6.1}{\(2 points\) First things first: since we are dealing with a supervised task, we will need to split our data into a training and testing set. Furthermore, since some of our regressors will involve hyper-parameter tuning, we will also need a validation set. Use the multi\137way\137split\(\) method from mpctools.extensions.skext to split the data into a Training \(60\045\), Validation \(15\045\) and Testing \(25\045\) set: use the ShuffleSplit object from sklearn for the splitter.

\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.6.2}{\(4 points\) Let us start with a baseline. By using only the y-values, what baseline regressor can you define \(indicate what it does\)?

\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.6.3}{\(3 points\) Let us now try a more interesting algorithm: specifically, we will start with LinearRegression. Train the regressor on the training data and report the RMSE on the training and validation set, and comment on the relative performance to the baseline.}{section.6}% 38
\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.6.4}{\(5 points\) We want to explore further what the model is learning. Explain why in Linear Regression, we cannot just blindly use the weights of the regression coefficients to evaluate the relative importance of each feature, but rather we have to normalise the features. By referring to the documentation for the LinearRegression implementation in SKLearn, explain what the normalisation does and how it helps in comparing features. Will this affect the performance of the Linear Regressor?}{section.6}% 39
\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.6.5}{\(5 points\) Retrain the regressor, setting normalize=True and report \(in a table\) the ratio of the relative importance of each feature. Which is the most/least important site? How do they compare with the correlation coefficients for Site 17 as computed in Question 4:\(f\), and why do you think that is?}{section.6}% 40
\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.6.6}{\(5 points\) It might be that with non-linear models, we may get better performance. Let us try to use K-Nearest-Neighbours. Train a KNN regressor with default parameters on the training set and report performance on the training and validation set. Hint: it might be beneficial to set n\137jobs=-1 to improve performance. How does it compare with Linear Regression in terms of performance on both sets? What is a limitation of the KNN algorithm for our dataset?}{section.6}% 41
\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.6.7}{\(4 points\) The KNN regression allows setting a number of hyper-parameters. We will optimise only one: the number of neighbours to use. By using the validation set, find the optimal value for the n\137neighbours parameter out of the values [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]. Plot the training/validation RMSE and indicate \(for example with a line\) the best value for n\137neighbours.}{section.6}% 42

\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.6.9}{\(4 points\) Let us try one last regression algorithm: we will now use DecisionTreeRegressor. Again, the algorithm contains a number of hyper-parameters, and we will optimise the depth of the tree. Train a series of Decision Tree Regressors, optimising \(over the validation set\) the max\137depth over the values [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64]. Set random\137state=0. Plot the training/validation RMSE and indicate \(as before\) the best value for max\137depth.}{section.6}% 44
